        <h2>Who we are</h2>
        <p>We are a family owned business that started during the pandemic in 2020, we struggled to maintain our business but we managed to pull through 
            with everyones effort and now we were able to move out of the small building we rented into a newer building that is three times the size with more space for better
            equipment. We strive to always produce the best food in the city and we take customer feedback so we can improve our services to the people
            that come from all over the state to eat at our restraunt.
