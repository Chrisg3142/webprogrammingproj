        <h2>Who we are</h2>
        <p>We are a family owned business that started during the pandemic in 2020, we struggled to maintain our business but we managed to pull through 
            with everyones effort and now we were able to move out of the small building we rented into a newer building that is three times the size with more space for better
            equipment. We strive to always produce the best food in the city and we take customer feedback so we can improve our services to the people
            that come from all over the state to eat at our restraunt. 
        </p>
        <h2>Our locations</h2>
        <p>We currently only have one location open in Downtown Brooklyn, NY. We first moved out from our first location back in 2023 and we plan to expand to areas in Queens and Manhattan once we grow our restraunt
            and have enough time and money to be able to expand.
        </p>

        <h2>What we offer</h2>
        <p>We currently serve a mix of Ecuardian and American cusine with food from all over the states and cities of both countries. We have friends and family from both countries that came to teach us their family recipes to the meals we offer on out menu.
        We try to give our best meals out there and if there is something that you believe would make our food better we take everything into consideration from the reviews posted on our review pages.</p>

        <h2>Our ingredients</h2>
            <p>All our ingreadients are sourced directly from farms or local farmers markets to support the local community and provide the best ingredients into our food to be able to give
                the best flavor. We believe in fresh and never frozen, we always get new deliveries everyday so we never serve food from the previous day or any frozen foods. 
            </p>

        <h2>Our Service</h2>
        <p>We do our best to give you the best possible service when you are in our care, if you have any special requests for a meal such as allergies, temperature, how you want vegetables preferred, or preparing the food in a certain way that helps you eat easier.
            We also donate all our leftover food to a local shelter right before closing time so nothing goes to waste.
        </p>
