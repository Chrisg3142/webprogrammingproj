# webprogrammingproj
This is my second project working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
I am still learning so there are some problems with the site that I can not fix yet but I am learning and trying to learn how to makea better site both in the front-end and back-end.
I also worked on this project from different devices at school and at home by learning and using Git.
